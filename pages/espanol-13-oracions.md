# uno: The apple is red.

La manzana es roja.

Subject Verb Object

* La manzana - apple. a feminine noun, so preceeded by *la* instead of *el*.  Most words that end in *a* are feminine. TBD general rules for noun gender.
* es - third-person present tense of *ser*. Ser means"to be" when used with permanent or inherent properties of something.  redness is a permanent property of the apple, so use *ser* instead of *estar*.  If we were referring to ripeness, we would say "La manzana ésta maduro", because ripeness is a changing property of the apple.  TBD - details on this.
* roja - adjective, red. red is rojo or roja, depending on the the gender of the noun it modifies.  manzana is feminine, so roja.
