Trece oracións de Tim Ferriss

# uno: The apple is red.
La manzana es roja.

* La manzana - a feminine noun, so preceeded by la instead of el.
* es - third-person present tense conjugation of *ser*, the verb "to be" when used with permanent properties of something.  redness is a permanent property of the apple, so use *ser* instead of *estar*.  If we were referring to ripeness, we would say "La manzana ésta maduro", because ripeness is a changing property of the apple. 
* roja - adjective, red. red is rojo or roja, depending on the the gender of the noun it modifies.  manzana is feminine, so roja.
